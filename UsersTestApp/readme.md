# Notes

For this application to run, you need to copy the `x86` and `x64` folders from
the `Prius.SQLite/lib` folder into the `bin` folder. There is a post build step
that does this.

If you are using this sample as a starting point for your own application, you
should modify the post build step to copy these files from the NuGet package.
